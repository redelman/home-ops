# README
This repo is heavily inspired by [onedr0p/cluster-template](https://github.com/onedr0p/cluster-template).

It is my gitops style IAC code to manage my home lab.

The main components of this repo again come from [onedr0p/cluster-template](https://github.com/onedr0p/cluster-template).
It makes heavy use of Proxmox, OpenTofu and SOPs at this time. Expected to come are utilities to help with installing
[Talos Linux](https://www.talos.dev/), which is planned to be entirely managed by [Flux](https://fluxcd.io/). I'll
write more on this later.

# Using this repo
At this time, this repo is mostly public just so others can study it.

# Contributing
If you're going to run the exact same things I have, or know how to fix any TODO items or improve upon the code I 
have here, feel free to submit a PR.

Long term, I'd like to create another project similiar to onedr0p's cluster-template, and go from there. That project,
and this repo itself, will serve as inspiration for it. Onedr0p's repo is very heavily focused on bare-metal, while I
would like to see something that's a mix of bare metal and virtualization. Once I spin up that project, I will
link to it here.

# Homelab Details
I'll fill this out later. ;)
